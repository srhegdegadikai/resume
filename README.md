* Repo hosts my resume and the code used to build it
* Resume is rendered as PDF using (vitae)[https://pkg.mitchelloharawild.com/vitae/#vitae-] R package & (Rmarkdown)[https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com]
* Everything is maintained as code (GitOps philosophy)
* The actual PDF file with resume contents is built using Github-actions
